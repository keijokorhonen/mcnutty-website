Official Website for McNutty Initiatives

McNutty Initiatives© reassures that any alleged similarities to the
"Khan Academy" site are a figment of the imagination. A reputable company such
as McNutty Initiatives© would under no circumstance resort to copying the 8th
world wonder that is Khan Academy. Nevertheless, McNutty Initiatives© would
like to apply the idiom "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."

While we're at it, McNutty Initiatives© is not in affiliation with the Holocaust.
